parsing data from telegrams using telethon

I wrote a program to extract the messages I need from a huge number of groups in a telegram.
The first method allows you to extract the latest messages from the designated groups and then updates them as they appear
The second method does the same as the first, but an additional parameter is the keyword,
let's say you need messages with the keyword "python" only, this code will collect messages with this word only.
This code can allow you to filter and filter out unnecessary information from a huge number of groups in the telegram to which you are subscribed
